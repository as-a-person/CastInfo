CastInfo is made in PHP.
<br>
CastInfo can make, delete, and change an array.
<br>
CastInfo also has this usrsave folder for saving stuff (prefs or arrays).
<br>
CastInfo can generate random hex codes of any size you desire (kinda like [babel](https://libraryofbabel.info)).
<br>
CastInfo has to run locally.
<br>
By the way, this is kinda like a joke project. And it's not fully developed.
