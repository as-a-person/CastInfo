CastInfo is made in PHP.
<br>
CastInfo can make, delete, and change stuff/info in or out of an array.
<br>
CastInfo can generate random hex codes of any size you desire (kinda like (babel)[https://libraryofbabel.info]).
<br>
CastInfo has to run locally.
<br>
By the way, this is kinda like a joke project. And it's not fully developed.
